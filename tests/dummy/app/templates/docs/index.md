# What is Ember Window Messenger?

This Ember addon is a lightweight postMessage client/server implementation. It is built on promises so the `fetch` and `rpc` methods can be used directly in your route `model()` hooks.

**JSON only messages are supported for now.**

## Getting started

`ember install ember-window-messenger`
